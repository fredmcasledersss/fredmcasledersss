A key vote occurs Wednesday in the Senate Banking and Financial Institutions Committee. Make no mistake, as in the past, this is a giant uphill battle. The chairman, Sen. Lou Correa, D-Santa Ana, received $70,400 from 2008 to 2012 from the industry – and he is not alone. Getting this bill to the Senate floor will require pressure from the public, Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg and Gov. Jerry Brown.

The need for change is clear. Under current California law, for a two-week payday loan of $300 – from companies such as Advance America, Moneytree Inc., Checksmart Financial and Cash Plus Inc. – borrowers pay a fee of $45, leaving $255 in cash. That fee is equivalent to an outrageous annual percentage rate of 460 percent for a two-week loan.
