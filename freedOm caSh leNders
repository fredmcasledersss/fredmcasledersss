The bill's centerpiece is creation of an annual cap on the number of high-cost payday loans lenders can give to any borrower, enforced by a statewide database (similar to databases in 11 other states).

The authors have settled on a six-loan cap, modeled on FDIC guidance to banks that says high-cost debt should not be provided for more than 90 days in a 12-month period, or six loans. That is watered-down from the bill's original four-loan cap, an attempt to be responsive to the payday loan industry. Delaware has a five-loan cap; Washington state, an eight-loan cap.

If legislators won't limit interest rates for payday loans, they should at least hold the payday industry accountable for loans being used as advertised â€“ as a short-term cash-flow tool for one-time financial emergencies. Lawmakers should approve an annual cap on the number of payday loans per borrower.
